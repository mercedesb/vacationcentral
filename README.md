# The Idea:

When talking with friends about vacation, I am frequently asked for thoughts about where we stayed, what restaurants we enjoyed and what activities we enjoyed. 

Vacation Central is a place to store all of that information so that it is easily accessible from anywhere. If having all the details in one place makes current trips easier to manage, so much the better. 

# Getting Started:

Software Installation - Vacation Central does not require any software installation to operate.
    
Prerequisites - Loving your vacations past, present and future.
